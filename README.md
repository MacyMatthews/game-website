Virtual Arcade project that gave me the opportunity to learn javaScript, HTML, and CSS over my summer break. Contains hyperlinks to the snake game, space invaders, and memory game webpages for easy navigation of the Virtual Arcade. The code for the three games in the Virtual Arcade are in their own repositories.
