Virtual Arcade project that gave me the opportunity to learn javaScript, HTML, and CSS over my summer break. Compiles the snake game, space invaders, and memory game webpages into one webpage for easy navigation of the different games. The code for the three games in the Virtual Arcade are in their own repositories.
