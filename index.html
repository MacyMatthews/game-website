    <p>Hello! This is a project I have been working on with the goal of developing my JavaScript skills and dabbling in some HTML and CSS. I feel eager to apply 
       what I have learned to future projects, and I can't wait to further evolve my 
       knowledge of game and web design and creation. I hope you play some games and have fun. Thanks for visiting!</p>
